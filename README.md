# UPE_Coding_Challenge_Spring19
UPE Coding Challenge for Spring 2019

My program can be run using the script.sh file.

Please run the command

./script.sh

This will run all 5 levels of the maze with the hack.py file.

My python version is version Python 3.5.4.


The python file can be run on a single level 

using:
	python3 hack.py

However, I used to script to get the FINISHED response.
